Recently I have been struggling when trying to embed a [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet) map on my blog, hosted in GitHub via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). In my case, I use the [**Beautiful Jekyll**](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/getstarted/) implementation created by @daattali.
