Leaflet, R, Jekyll and GitHub
================

Recently I have been struggling when trying to embed a
[leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet) map on my blog, hosted in
GitHub via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). In my case, I use the
[**Beautiful
Jekyll**](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/getstarted/)
implementation created by @daattali.
